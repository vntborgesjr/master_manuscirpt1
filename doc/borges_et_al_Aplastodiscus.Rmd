## i) did abundance of tadpoles differ between streams?

We captured and measured 1687 tadpoles o __A. eugenioi__ in the two streams sampled. Tadpoles of A. eugenioi occurred in stream 1 during all 36 months of the study. In stream 2, tadpoles were found in 26 months and were more frequntly found in the dry season. The abundance of tadpoles in streams were heterocedastic and not normal, as it is visualized in boxplot and histogram. The analyses of the residuals of ANOVA indicated that the premisses of  normality and homocedasticity were not met, so we use Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (non-parametric ANOVA). Resutls indicated that the abundance of tadpoles difered significantly between streams.

```{r , echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# total number of tadpoles
total <- sum(abund$Abundance)

# total number of tadpoles per season in each stream
total.stream.season <- tapply(abund$Abundance, list(abund$Stream, abund$Season), sum)

# Frequence of occurrence of tadpoles of each stream during the studied period
freq1 <- aggregate(abund$Count, list(abund$Months, abund$Season, abund$Stream), sum)
freq1$x <- ifelse(freq1$x >= 1, 1, 0)
freq.total1 <- aggregate(freq1$x, list(freq1$Group.3), sum)

# Difference in abundance of tadpoles between streams
boxplot(abund$Abundance ~ abund$Stream, ylab = "Number of tadpoles")

## ii) did tadpoles of different class of development tend to occur *more frequently* and to be more abundant in the rainy or in the dry season?

Tadpoles of class I.2 were the most frequent being registered all months, followed by tadpoles of class II, I.1, and III. Except for tadpoles of class I.1 that was more frequent in the dry period, tadpoles of all other classes were more frequent in the rainy period.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
# Frequence of occurrence of tadpoles of each class of development during the studied period
freq <- aggregate(abund$Count, list(abund$Class, abund$Months, abund$Season), sum)
freq$x <- ifelse(freq$x >= 1, 1, 0)
freq.total <- aggregate(freq$x, list(freq$Group.1), sum)
names(freq.total) <- c("Class", "Total")
freq.total

# Frequence of occurrence of tadpoles of each class of development between seasons during the studied period
tapply(freq$x, list(freq$Group.1, freq$Group.3), sum)

```

## ii) did tadpoles of different class of development tend to occur more frequently and to be *more abundant* in the rainy or in the dry season (absolute and index of abundance, and mean abundance)?

We captured and measured 1687 tadpoles o __A. eugenioi__. The most common tadpoles belonged to class I.2 and the rarer to class III. Tadpoles of all development class were more abundant in the dry period both in absolute values, by the index and the mean. The exception were tadpoles of class I.2 that were more comomn in the rainy season.

```{r , echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
total <- sum(rowSums(tapply(abund$Abundance, list(abund$Class, abund$Season), sum)))

# total number of tadpoles in each class o development
rowSums(tapply(abund$Abundance, list(abund$Class, abund$Season), sum))

# total abundance of tadpoles of __A. eugenioi__ of different calsses of development and seasons
tapply(abund$Abundance, list(abund$Class, abund$Season), sum)

abund1 <- aggregate(as.vector(abund$Abundance), list(abund$Class, abund$Season, abund$Months), sum)
names(abund1) <- c("Class", "Season", "Month", "Abundance")

tapply(abund$ind.abund, list(abund$Class, abund$Season), sum)
abund.ind <- aggregate(as.vector(abund$ind.abund), list(abund$Class, abund$Season, abund$Months), sum)
names(abund.ind) <- c("Class", "Season", "Month", "Abundance")

# mean abundance of tadpoles of __A. eugenioi__ of different calsses of development and seasons
tapply(abund$Abundance, list(abund$Class, abund$Season), mean)

abund.mean <- aggregate(as.vector(abund$Abundance), list(abund$Class, abund$Season, abund$Months), mean)

```

## ii) did tadpoles of different class of development tend to occur more frequently and to be *more abundant* in the rainy or in the dry season? ANOVA of the abundance of *all tadpoles* between seasons

Both absolut abundances, the index, and mean abundance showed evidences of heterocedasticity and lack of normality bewteen seasons, as it is visualized in boxplot and histogram. The results of ANOVA indicated no differences in abudances between seasons. The analyses of residuals indicated that the premisses of  normality and homocedasticity were not met.

## ii) did tadpoles of different class of development *from each stream* tend to occur *more frequently* and to be *more abundant* in the rainy or in the dry season? ANOVA of the abundance of tadpoles of *different classes* between seasons in stream 1

In stream 1, tadpoles of class I.1 were the second least abundant (4.1%, n = 61). They were more frequent (30.5%, n = 11 months) and abundant (2.5%, n = 38) in the dry period. We found no statistical differences in abundances of tadpoles of class I.1 between seasons (F2.34 = 1.146, p = 0.292). Tadpoles of class I.2 occurred in all months and were the most abundant, representing 80.5% (n = 1199) of all tadpoles found in stream 1. We registered their highest abundance in the rainy season (48.5%, n = 716). Tadpoles of class I.2 were statisticaly more abundant in the rainy period (F2.34 = 4.705, p = 0.037). Tadpoles of class II the second most abundant (14.2%, n = 212) and frequent (n = 30 months). They were found more frequently during the rainy season (47.2%, n = 17), but we registered their highest abundance in the dry season (9.2%, n = 137). We did not find statistical differences in the abundances of tadpoles of class II between seasons (X2 = 0.004, p = 0.949). Tadpoles of class III (final stage of metamorphose) were the least abundant in stream 1 with only 18 individuals (1.2%) and occurred more frequnetly in the rainy season (25%, n = 9 months). We did not find significant difference in the number of tadpoles of class III between seasons (F2. = 0.569, p = 0.456).

## ii) did tadpoles of different class of development *from each stream* tend to occur *more frequently* and to be *more abundant* in the rainy or in the dry season? ANOVA of the abundance of tadpoles of *different classes* between seasons in stream 2

In stream 2, tadpoles of class I.1 were the second least abundant (13.7%, n = 27). They were more frequent (16.6%, n = 6 months) and abundant (11.2%, n = 22) in the dry period. We found no statistical differences in abundances of tadpoles of class I.1 between seasons (X2 = 0.818, p = 0.365). Tadpoles of class I.2 occurred were the most abundant, representing 62.4% (n = 123) of all tadpoles found in stream 2. They were more frequent (36.1%, n = 13) and abundant in the dry season (38.6%, n = 76). Tadpoles of class I.2 did not differ statisticaly between seasons (F2.34 = 1.183, R2 = 0.005, p = 0.284). Tadpoles of class II the second most abundant (19.8%, n = 39). They were more abundant (14.2%, n = 28) and found more frequently during the dry season (27.7%, n = 10). We did not find statistical differences in the abundances of tadpoles of class II between seasons (X2 = 1.837, p = 0.175). Tadpoles of class III (final stage of metamorphose) were the least abundant in stream 2 with only 8 individuals (4.1%) and occurred more frequnetly in the dry season (8.3%, n = 3 months) when they were also more abundant (3.5%, n = 7). We did not find significant difference in the number of tadpoles of class III between seasons (X2 = 1.1524, p = 0.283).

## iii) did tadpoles of each class of development differ in body length between the two streams? 

Mean body length of tadpoles were larger in stream 1 but only differed significantlly in tadpoles of development classes I.1 and I.2. Mean body length of tadpoles of class I.1 (4.57 + 0.43mm) and class I.2 (8.87 + 2.29mm) in stream 1 were larger than in stream 2 (I.1: 3.92 + 0.73mm; I.2: 8.34 + 2.05mm) (ANOVA-I.1; F2.86 = 26.58, R2 = 0.227, p < 0.001; ANOVA-I.2; F2.1303 = 5.84, R2 = 0.003, p = 0.015). We did not find significant differences in body length of tadpoles in class II (ANOVA-II; F2.249 = 2.82, R2 = 0.007, p = 0.094) and class III (Kruskal-Wallis; X2 = 1.617, p = 0.203) between the two streams.

## iv) was tadpole abundance affected by the rainfall of the previous month?

The mensal rainfall affected the abundance of tadpoles differently between streams. In stream 1, we observed week but positive relationship between the abundance of tadpoles and rainfall (GLM, p = 0.047; Figure ). Conversely, we found a negative relationship between the abundance of tadpoles and rainfall in stream 2 (GLM, p = 0.013; Figure ).

### O que eu acho que ainda daria para fazer, seguindo a l처gica do  seu coment찼rio (chuva promove aumento do n첬mero de girinos pequenos), 챕 utilizar como covari찼vel o est찼gio de desenvolvimento e inserir um termo de intera챌찾o entre chuva e est찼gio de desenvolvimento. Da챠, ter챠amos como resposta desse modelo a rela챌찾o da chuva com cada est찼gio de desenvolvimento. Tipo, aumentou a chuva aumentou o n첬mero de girinos rec챕m eclodidos. S찾o 4 est찼gios de desenvolvimento, logo 4 par창metros a mais nos modelos. Acham que vale a pena???
